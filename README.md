# guiltypleasuresbymm

Guilty Pleasures started completely grass roots style. Millie was always a dessert olympian, but having no candy making experience, began with trial and error. It all began in a small apartment kitchen and turned into what it is today; we proudly serve over 40 locations across Michigan.  Millie has been a full-time user since a young age. Marijuana has always been something she has had extreme passion about because it helped her through many difficult times, overcoming anxiety and depression, and witnessing the way it helped people with serious illnesses. With the help of her 2 amazing managers, Jessica and Leah, they have been able to build this company from nothing and provide so many people with good medicine.  Jessica and Leah both have impeccable experience and knowledge in the industry, but most importantly have passion behind educating themselves and consumers on a healthier alternative to prescription medications. With 3 perspectives, 3 different styles of approaching things, 3 different tasting preferences, they are able to combine all their ideas to bring forth an array of quality products.  Our current offerings include gummies, sugar gems (AKA hard candy), and fortune crisps (AKA fortune cookies) but have intention to release many more products by the end of 2019.  Stay tuned.....
